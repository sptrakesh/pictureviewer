# pictureviewer
A simple photo/image/â€¦ viewer built using a QLabel.  Drop directories/folders you wish to view (including Apple Photos Photos Library.photoslibrary special bundle folder) and let the application display the image files it finds in sequence.  You can drop multiple directories/folders on to the application window, and it will find all viewable files and play them.
