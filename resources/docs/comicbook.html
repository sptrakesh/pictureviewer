            <h2>Create Comic Book's</h2>
            <div>
              Comic book archive or reader files are simple archives
              containing a sequence of image files with a special
              naming convention.  Standard archive formats like
              <code>tar, zip, 7z, rar</code> are used with a special
              file suffix to indicate the type of archive used.  Readers
              are able to unarchive and display the contents of these files.
            </div>
            <h3>Supported formats</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>rar</strong> - Archives created using <code>rar</code>
                compression codec.  The desired images are
                added to a standard rar file using the <code>rar</code>
                extension.  Once generated, the file is renamed to have the
                <code>cbr</code> extension which helps readers identify the
                codec as <code>rar</code>.</li>
              <li><strong>zip</strong> - Archives created using <code>zip</code>
                compression codec.  The desired images are
                added to a standard zip file using the <code>zip</code>
                extension.  Once generated, the file is renamed to have the
                <code>cbz</code> extension which helps readers identify the
                codec as <code>zip</code>.</li>
              <li><strong>tar</strong> - Archives created using <code>tar</code>
                archive format.  The desired images are
                added to a standard tar file using the <code>tar</code>
                extension.  Once generated, the file is renamed to have the
                <code>cbt</code> extension which helps readers identify the
                codec as <code>tar</code>.</li>
              <li><strong>7z</strong> - Archives created using <code>7z</code>
                archive format.  The desired images are
                added to a standard 7z file using the <code>7z</code>
                extension.  Once generated, the file is renamed to have the
                <code>cb7</code> extension which helps readers identify the
                codec as <code>7z</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Note</h3>
            <div>
              The output file is renamed to have the standard <code>cbr,
              cbz, cbt, cb7</code> extension.  If a target file with the
              same extension already exists, it will be replaced by the
              new file being generated.
            </div>
            <h3>Credits</h3>
            <div>
              The archive is created using <code>libarchive</code>.  We
              also use the <code>QArchive</code> Qt library as the wrapper
              around <code>libarchive</code>.
