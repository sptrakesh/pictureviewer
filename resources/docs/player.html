                    <h2 style="color:blue;">Version 1.2.0</h2>
                    A simple photo/image/&hellip; viewer built using a QLabel.
                    Drop directories/folders you wish to view (including
                    Apple Photos <em>Photos Library.photoslibrary</em> special
                    bundle folder) and let the application display the image
                    files it finds in sequence.  You can drop multiple
                    directories/folders on to the application window, and
                    it will find all viewable files and play them.
                    <br /><br />
                    Image files are loaded in background thread(s), ensuring
                    that the player window stays usable and responsive at
                    all times.  When multiple directories/folders are dropped
                    (together using multiple selection or in quick succession),
                    the directories/folders are scanned in parallel using
                    multiple threads.  Hence, files from different directory
                    trees will be loaded interleaving each other and displayed
                    in the sequence that the various threads found them.
                    <h3>Controls</h3>
                    The application can be used to
                    automatically "play" the image files it finds across
                    directory trees, or flip through the files manually.
                    <ul class="disc">
                      <li><strong>Play</strong> - automatically flip through
                      all images discovered in the loaded directory trees in
                      sequence (that it was found) at intervals ranging from
                      0 to 15 seconds.  Use the bottom right hand slider to
                      control the interval at which the files are displayed.</li>
                      <li><strong>Manual</strong> - The player automatically
                      starts displaying image files it finds.  Pause the player
                      to enter into manual mode.  In manual mode use the
                      <em>Next</em> (right arrow key or menu), or <em>Previous</em>
                      (left arrow key or menu) to flip through the image files
                      that were discovered.</li>
                      <li><strong>Stop Scanning</strong> - Useful for very
                      large directory trees. You can stop the scan for files
                      at any given time. The player will continue to display
                      the files that have been discovered thus far.</li>
                      <li><strong>Display sleep</strong> - When left in
                      default (checked) mode, user preferences (Energy Saver
                      option on Mac OS X) controls whether display goes
                      to sleep or not.  If <em>unchecked</em>, uses the
                      <code>caffeinate</code> command to prevent the display
                      from going to sleep while app is running. For Windows,
                      use the SetThreadExecutionState function to achieve
                      the same effect.</li>
                      <li><strong>Show File</strong> - Display the current
                      displayed file in the native file manager - <em>Finder</em>
                      on Mac OS X, and <em>Explorer</em> on Windows.</li>
                      <li><strong>Show Exif</strong> - Enabled only for
                      JPEG files.  Displays Exif information if available
                      in the file.</li>
                      <li><strong>Delete File</strong> - Delete the current
                      displayed file permanently from the underlying file
                      system.</li>
                      <li><strong>Watermark</strong> - Watermark currently
                      viewed file, or all files in the parent directory.
                      See <a href="watermark.html">watermark</a> for details.</li>
                      <li><strong>Create PDF</strong> - Create PDF files
                      with either the current displayed image, or all files
                      loaded in the player window.  See
                      <a href="pdfmaker.html">pdfmaker</a> for details.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Limitations</h3>
                    At present the slider bars for controlling the time
                    interval (bottom right) and index within the list of
                    image files discovered (bottom left) are permanently
                    displayed.  In a future release, the bottom slider
                    area may be automatically displayed/hidden.
