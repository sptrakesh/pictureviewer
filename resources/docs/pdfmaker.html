                <h2>Create PDF's</h2>
                <div>
                  You can create PDF files out of the current displayed
                  file, or all the files that are loaded in the player
                  window.
                </div>
                <h2>Options</h2>
                <h3>Source File</h3>
                <div>
                  Use the <em>Source File</em> option to specify whether
                  you with to create a PDF with just the current displayed
                  file (default option), or with all the files loaded in
                  the player window.
                </div>
                <h3>Paper Size</h3>
                </div>
                  Select the page/paper size you wish for the output PDF.  Smaller
                  page size will usually lead to smaller final file size.
                  For instance, using our test folder with about 35 images,
                  the resulting PDF size was about 500Mb for A4 paper,
                  while the size was reduced to 148Mb for A6 paper.
                <div>
                <h3>Title</h3>
                <div>
                  The title to set in PDF file metadata.  No default value
                  will be set in the output file if not specified.
                </div>
                <h3>Creator</h3>
                <div>
                  The creator to set in PDF file metadata.  The default
                  value will be the Qt version used to build this application.
                </div>
                <h3>Sort Files</h3>
                <div>
                  Relevant only when creating a PDF with all the files
                  loaded in the player window.  Indicates whether the
                  file name should be sorted in alphabetical order to
                  generate the output PDF.  The default file listing has
                  no deterministic order if generated from a directory or
                  directories.  If you have dragged and dropped individual
                  files in the desired order into the player window, then
                  you should not let the application sort the files (uncheck
                  the checkbox), and it will honour the order you specified.
                </div>
                <h3>Show File</h3>
                <div>
                  Check the <em>Show File</em> check-box to display the
                  generated PDF file in the native file manager for your
                  platform (Finder on Mac OS X, and Explorer on Windows).
                </div>
                <h3>Compression</h3>
                <div>
                  JPEG compression to apply to the scaled image before
                  drawing on the output PDF page(s).  The default of
                  <em>100</em> will use no compression.  You can experiment
                  with various values and balance output filesize vs
                  quality of the output.
                </div>
                <div>
                  <strong>Note:</strong> Enabling compression slows down
                  the PDF generation process quite a bit.
                </div>
                <h3>Limitation</h3>
                <div>
                  PDF files generated from images are very large.  This
                  is especially the case when scaling smaller images to
                  file an entire page.  The upscaling from pixels to fill
                  in platform native DPI leads to most images bloating
                  in size.  For instance, while testing a folder with
                  about 35 images with a combined size of 11Mb, the resulting
                  PDF generated was about 500Mb.
